### Feature Channels
Focused workspaces for specific functionality development:

- **Team Composition**
  - Led by designated Technical Lead
  - Staffed by developers not assigned to other active channels
  - Dedicated to specific product functionality

- **Goal Tracking**
  - Technical Lead defines implementation goals
  - Developers register contributions against goals
  - Progress visualization through completion metrics

- **Lifecycle**
  - Active during development phase
  - Marked complete when all goals are achieved
  - Success reflected in product channel metrics

## Workflow
